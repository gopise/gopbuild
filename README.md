# gopbuild
A simple build toolset for Linux BSP.

Originally for "Yocto haters" who want to build a simple system without Yocto environment.
It will use SDK from Yocto or any other source to build the uboot/kernel and apps.

1. Only tested on Freescale i.MX6 platform.
2. A pre-built base rootfs image will be used as a foundation for customize.

Only for joy ;)
